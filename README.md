Black Scholes Model Implementation in C#

Overview
This project provides an implementation of the Black Scholes Model using C#. The Black Scholes Model is a widely used mathematical model for pricing options contracts. With this implementation, 
you can calculate the premiums for both Call (CE) and Put (PE) options based on different parameters such as stock price, strike price, time period, rate of interest, and volatility.

How to Use
To calculate the premium for a Call option using the Black Scholes Model, you can use the Call_bsm method provided in the code. Here's a brief overview of the parameters:

StockPrice: Current price of the underlying stock.
StrikePrice: Price at which the option can be exercised.
TimePeriod: Time to expiration of the option, in years.
RateofInterest: Annual risk-free interest rate.
roh_Volatility: Volatility of the underlying stock.
